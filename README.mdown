# pilgrim 
(early development)

Uses geospatial and historical data to connect you to past events at a given location    
... in theory. It's basically an empty repo at this point

## to do

a whole bunch of stuff :)  
basically revisiting this project from scratch, & wiping a lot of existing non-features
